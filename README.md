# Evolution-Simulator
The purpose of this evolution simulator is to help me learn new coding skills and algorithms. The simulator auto generates a new map where creature with very simple traits try to survive for as long as they can for a given period of time. After this period of time, a new generation that went under some minor changes is produced from the older generation. The new generation is then put to the test for the same period of time. After many generation a dominant species should exist and rule this simple world. More information about the species traits and the program will be in the README file.
